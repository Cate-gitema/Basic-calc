# Basic-calc
This is a simple and basic calculator
🧮 Basic Calculator in Python
📖 Description
This is a simple calculator program written in Python for beginners. It allows the user to input two numbers and choose a mathematical operation to perform: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The result is then displayed in a user-friendly format.

This project is a great way to practice:

Working with variables

User input and output

Data type conversion

Basic arithmetic operations

Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

🚀 How to Run
Requirements
Python 3.x

Steps
Download or copy the calculator.py file.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the file is located.

Run the program using:

bash
Copy
Edit
python calculator.py
Follow the prompts:

Enter the first number

Enter the second number

Enter the operation (+, -, *, or /)

💡 Example
bash
Copy
Edit
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
🔐 Error Handling
Division by zero is prevented with an error message.

Only valid operations (+, -, *, /) are accepted.

(Optional enhancement) Input validation can be added to prevent non-numeric inputs.

📚 Learning Goals
Understanding user input

Converting strings to numbers (float)

Using formatted strings (f-strings)

Writing basic conditional logic in Python

🛠️ Future Improvements
Loop the program to allow multiple calculations without restarting.

Add support for more operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).

Implement input validation and error checking.

Create a GUI version using tkinter.
